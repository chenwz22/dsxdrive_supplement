Modeling code and NGS data processing code have been deposited here (https://github.com/chenwz22/dsxdrive_supplement/) and at a permanent doi (doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18616343) for the study: Experimental and modeling demonstration of stronger population suppression by gene drive targeting doublesex from dominant female-sterile resistance alleles. There are no restrictions on access to the code and data.

HSD files are plasmid sequence.
MND,FND and FD files are process NGS data,Raw reads were uploaded on the NCBI database (SRR36699526, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRR36699526, SRR36699527, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRR366995267, SRR36699528, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRR366995268)
slim file is the code for model silmulation.
