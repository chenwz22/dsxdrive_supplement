There are no restrictions on access to the code and data.

HSD files are plasmid sequence.
MND,FND and FD files are process NGS data, Raw reads were uploaded on the NCBI database (SRR36699526, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRR36699526, SRR36699527, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRR366995267, SRR36699528, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRR366995268)
slim file is the code for model silmulation.
